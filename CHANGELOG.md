# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-25

### Changed

- **Target frameworks** upgraded from .NET 8 to **.NET 10**: Server, tests, InjectorHelper,
  Shared (`net10.0`), Injector (`net10.0`), and Inspector CoreCLR leg (`net10.0-windows`).
  The **net48** legs remain for .NET Framework WPF injection.
- Microsoft.Extensions.* and Serilog.Extensions.Hosting bumped to 10.x; CI / Docker SDK to 10.0.
- CoreCLR Inspector `runtimeconfig` now declares `tfm: net10.0` and
  `Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App` 10.0.0.

### Fixed

- **PropertyWatcher** reported the watch-start value as `oldValue` on every change; now uses the
  previous value (`LastValue`).
- **NamedPipeBridge** mapped only `TimeoutException` to a friendly timeout message; cancellation
  from connect/read CTS now surfaces the same clear error.
- **ElementHighlighter** used `Window.Left`/`Top` (wrong under DPI / maximized); now uses
  `PointToScreen`, and reports failure when highlight cannot be shown.
- **XAML export** `elementCount` was always 0 (counted `"handle"` substrings); now counts XAML
  element open tags.
- **ControlInteractor** rejected Popup content with `IsVisible == false`; aligns with TreeWalker
  and allows interaction with open dropdowns/menus.
- **`wpf_get_element_properties`** returned empty lists: (1) `double.NaN`/`Infinity` were emitted
  as invalid JSON tokens; (2) the server parser called `JsonElement.GetString()` on bool/number
  values and aborted. Both fixed — properties now round-trip correctly.

### Known issues

- `wpf_watch_property` still cannot push change notifications to the MCP client (IPC is
  request/response only); the watch API and `oldValue` fix remain useful once a notification
  channel or poll API is added.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **`wpf_snapshot` / `snapshot`** (25th tool) — capture an element subtree's curated state
  (visibility, IsEnabled, Opacity, ActualWidth/Height, Margin/Padding, alignment,
  Background/Foreground/BorderBrush, text) under a label, keyed by element handle.
- **`wpf_diff` / `diff`** (26th tool) — diff two snapshots and report exactly what changed:
  for each element, the properties that changed (`from` → `to`), plus elements added or
  removed. Handles are stable per element, so the diff aligns the same element across the
  two snapshots.

Together they complete the "change → measure → is it effective?" loop: `wpf_snapshot`
(before) → a change (e.g. `wpf_set_property`) → `wpf_snapshot` (after) → `wpf_diff`.
Both tools are read-only.

### Notes

- Verified live: editing the layout root's `Margin` (0,0,0,0 → 40,40,40,40) and
  `Background` shows the direct change **and** the cascade — 13 descendants report reduced
  `ActualWidth`/`ActualHeight` (−80px = 40 per side), i.e. the diff surfaces the knock-on
  effect of a change, not just the edited property.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **`wpf_set_property` / `set-property`** (23rd tool) — live-edit any dependency property
  on an element at runtime, to test whether a planned UI change is effective without a
  rebuild. The string value is converted to the property's type via its `TypeConverter`
  (covers `Thickness`, `Brush`, `Visibility`, `GridLength`, `Color`, enums, `double`, ...);
  `{null}` sets null. Returns the coerced value read back and what previously held the
  property (`Binding` / `Local` / `Unset`). Read-only properties are rejected with a clear
  error.
- **`wpf_revert_property` / `revert-property`** (24th tool) — undo live edits: the most
  recent one, a filtered one (`element_handle` / `property_name`), or `all=true` for the
  whole experiment. Restores the exact prior state — including a **binding** that was
  overwritten (not just the last value), a local value, or clears to style/inherited/default
  when there was none. Backed by a per-session undo stack.

### Notes

- Setting a data-bound property replaces the binding with a local value (usually what you
  want for a quick test); `wpf_revert_property` puts the binding back. Verified live against
  the sample app: `Margin` and `Background` edits are visible in a screenshot, and
  overwriting a bound `Text` reports `previousSource: "Binding"` with the binding restored on
  revert.
- Pairs with `wpf_capture_screenshot` to see the effect. The planned `wpf_diff` (roadmap)
  will add automatic before/after measurement.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **`wpf_wait_for` / `wait-for`** (22nd tool) — wait until an element matching
  type/name/text satisfies a condition (`visible`, `exists`, `enabled`, `hidden`),
  polling inside the target app instead of sleep-and-retry from the agent. Returns
  `matched`, `waited_ms` and the matched handle/type. Use after an action that triggers
  async work (a dialog opens, a spinner clears, a button enables) before the next step.
  `timeout_ms` default 10000 (max 25000), `poll_interval_ms` default 250.

### Changed

- **`IpcServer` now accepts concurrent pipe connections.** Previously the pipe served
  one client at a time, so a long-running request (like a `wpf_wait_for` poll) blocked
  every other command. Each client is now handled on its own task; requests still
  serialize on the UI Dispatcher, so tree access stays safe. This also means the state
  change a `wpf_wait_for` is waiting on can arrive over a second connection.

### Notes

- `wpf_wait_for` is dispatched before the blocking `Dispatcher.Invoke` path and polls on
  the background thread (short Invoke per check + `Task.Delay` between), so the UI thread
  stays free and the awaited condition can actually change. Verified live against the
  sample app: waiting for the Submit button to become enabled returns as soon as the
  username is typed over a separate connection.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- **Binding errors were never captured.** `PresentationTraceSources.Refresh()` was
  never called, so WPF ignored the listener the Inspector attaches at runtime
  (`DataBindingSource` only honours runtime listener/switch changes after a
  Refresh, unless tracing was enabled via app.config or the registry).
  `wpf_get_binding_errors` therefore always returned an empty list, even with a
  broken binding on screen — the project's headline diagnostic feature was inert.
- **`wpf_get_binding_errors` dropped the errors it did have.** The server parsed the
  Inspector's `{"errors":[...],"count":N}` payload as a bare JSON array, silently
  yielding `errors: []` while reporting a non-zero `count`. The Inspector's own
  `count` was also computed with an array-item counter that overcounts objects.

### Added

- **NuGet packaging**: the server ships as a .NET tool (`dotnet tool install -g
  WpfVisualTreeMcp` → `wpfinspect` command) and as an **MCP server package**
  (`PackageType: McpServer`, runnable via `dnx WpfVisualTreeMcp`), with the native
  bootstrappers and the x86 injector helper bundled in the package.
- `.mcp/server.json` manifest for registry.modelcontextprotocol.io, plus a manual
  **Publish to MCP Registry** workflow (GitHub OIDC, no secrets).
- Release workflow now packs and pushes the NuGet package (needs `NUGET_API_KEY`)
  and attaches the `.nupkg` to the GitHub release.
- README: demo GIF, 60-second quickstart, and a comparison table against Snoop,
  FlaUI/WinAppDriver and generic computer-use agents.

### Changed

- CI fixes (both failures pre-dated this release): the Linux `code-quality` job now
  restores with `EnableWindowsTargeting`, and the release workflow publishes the
  multi-targeted Inspector with an explicit `--framework`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: IPC requests silently dropped every parameter.**
  `IpcSerializer.SerializeRequest` wrapped the payload in an anonymous object whose
  `data` member was statically typed as `IpcRequest` — System.Text.Json serializes
  by declared type, so every derived-class property (search filters, element
  handles, text to type, key combos, ...) never reached the Inspector. In practice:
  `find` always returned the first 50 elements unfiltered, and **all handle-based
  operations** (`props`, `layout`, `click`, `set-text`, ...) failed with
  "ElementHandle required". Only parameterless operations (window screenshot,
  default-depth tree) appeared to work. Fixed by serializing the payload by its
  runtime type (`data = (object)request`); guarded by round-trip regression tests
  in `IpcSerializerTests`.

### Added

- **Element query engine** in `wpf_find_elements` / `wpf_find_elements_deep`
  (CLI `find` / `find-deep`). New AND-combinable filters:
  - `text` — visible text content: button captions (even nested in templates),
    TextBlock/TextBox text, window title, `AutomationProperties.Name`, ToolTip;
    case-insensitive substring.
  - `property_filter` — property name → value substring (declared in the IPC
    contract since v0.1 but never implemented; now wired end-to-end).
  - `visible_only` — excludes collapsed/hidden elements, pruning invisible
    subtrees during traversal.
  - Results now include `text`, `automationId`, `isVisible`, `isEnabled` and
    `screenBounds` (physical pixels, same space as the OS mouse), so an agent can
    pick the right control without follow-up property dumps.
- **`wpf_select_item` / `select-item`** (21st tool) — select an item in any
  `Selector` control (ComboBox, ListBox, ListView, TabControl) by visible text or
  zero-based index. Drives `Items`/`SelectedIndex`, so it works with virtualized
  items that have no visual-tree container yet and raises proper selection events.
  Understands containers, `DisplayMemberPath`, overridden `ToString()`, realized
  `ItemTemplate` content, and common display properties; failed matches list the
  available items in the error.
- **`click_type` on `wpf_click_element` / `click`** — `double` and `right`
  (physical) clicks in addition to `single`; right-click opens context menus.
- **Screen-mode screenshots** — `wpf_capture_screenshot(mode='screen')` /
  `screenshot --mode screen` captures the actual on-screen pixels via GDI BitBlt
  (`CAPTUREBLT`), including open Popups, ComboBox dropdowns, context menus and
  tooltips that `RenderTargetBitmap` cannot see. Default `render` mode unchanged.
- **Scroll-into-view** before physical clicks and keyboard focus
  (`BringIntoView` + layout pass) so off-viewport elements get correct
  screen coordinates.
- **Read-back verification in `wpf_set_text` / `set-text`** — the response reports
  the element's value after the write (`value now: '...'`) and flags coercion or
  validation mismatches. Passwords report length only.

### Changed

- **Element handle cache uses weak references** (`ConditionalWeakTable` + reverse
  lookup) — the Inspector no longer keeps removed UI subtrees alive, and handle
  resolution is O(1) instead of a linear scan.
- **Stale-handle errors are consistent and actionable** across all 15 handle-based
  operations: they name the handle, explain why it expired, and say how to recover
  (re-run `wpf_find_elements`). "Not a UIElement" is now reported distinctly from
  "handle not found".
- `wpf_find_elements_deep` accepts `text` as its bounding criterion (previously
  required `type_name` or `element_name`).

### Testing

57 unit tests pass (9 new: IPC envelope round-trip regressions, query
pass-through, new-criteria validation).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Cross-architecture auto-injection.** A 64-bit server can now inject the
  Inspector into 32-bit WPF targets (and vice-versa), removing the v0.5.0
  known limitation. Implementation: a new tiny architecture-matching helper
  exe — [`WpfInjectorHelper`](src/WpfVisualTreeMcp.InjectorHelper/) — that
  performs the `CreateRemoteThread` + `LoadLibraryW` step in matching
  bitness. The server detects the target's bitness; when it matches the
  server's own, in-process injection is used as before; when it differs,
  the helper is spawned with `--pid` and `--dll` and its exit code reports
  success.
- **`ProcessInjector.InjectBootstrapper(int pid, string dllPath)`** public
  method — the helper's entry point; performs only the low-level remote
  LoadLibrary step with no architecture detection.

### Changed

- `WpfVisualTreeMcp.Injector` is now **multi-targeted** (`net48;net8.0`) so
  the new x86 .NET 8 helper can reference it without a cross-TFM warning.
  The existing net48 build path is unchanged.
- The Server publish now bundles five additional files under
  `native/x86/`: `WpfInjectorHelper.exe` (32-bit apphost),
  `WpfInjectorHelper.dll`, `WpfInjectorHelper.runtimeconfig.json`,
  `WpfInjectorHelper.deps.json`, and `WpfVisualTreeMcp.Injector.dll`.
  The release zip grows by ~140 KB.

### Removed

- **v0.5.0 known limitation eliminated.** Auto-injection no longer requires
  injector and target to share bitness — both x86 and x64 WPF apps can be
  driven from the same 64-bit server.

### Notes

- The x86 helper is **framework-dependent** — running it requires the
  32-bit .NET 8 Desktop Runtime on the machine. On a machine that already
  runs 32-bit .NET 8 WPF apps (e.g. OCONWPF) the runtime is already
  present. Otherwise install it from
  https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0.
- The reverse direction (an x86 server reaching x64 targets) would need a
  symmetric x64 helper; not shipped yet because the default deployment is
  x64. The error message from `ProcessInjector` makes that explicit when
  encountered.

### Testing

All 48 existing unit tests continue to pass.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **`wpf_set_text` MCP tool and `set-text` CLI command.** Replace the
  text/value of an element (TextBox, ComboBox, RichTextBox, PasswordBox, ...).
  - Default: UI Automation `IValueProvider.SetValue(text)` — clean, no focus
    needed, raises proper events, refuses read-only fields with a clear error.
  - Fallbacks when no value pattern is exposed: `TextBox.Text`,
    `PasswordBox.Password`, then a reflected string `Text` property (covers
    many third-party controls without an automation peer).
  - `physical=true` / `--physical` — focuses the element, clears existing
    text with `Ctrl+A` + `Delete`, then types each character via `SendInput`
    with `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` (full Unicode BMP, not just ASCII).

- **`wpf_send_keys` MCP tool and `send-keys` CLI command.** Send a keyboard
  shortcut / key combination to an element (or to whatever currently has
  focus, when no handle is given).
  - Modifiers: `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`, `Win`.
  - Keys: `A`-`Z`, `0`-`9`, `F1`-`F12`, `Enter`, `Esc`, `Tab`, `Space`,
    `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Insert`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`,
    `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`.
  - Examples: `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+Shift+F`, `Alt+F4`, `F5`, `Enter`, `Win+R`.

- `KeyComboParser` and `SendInput` + `KEYBDINPUT` interop in
  [`ControlInteractor`](src/WpfVisualTreeMcp.Inspector/ControlInteractor.cs);
  `SetTextResult` and `SendKeysResult` shared models.

### Changed

- `WpfTools` now exposes **20 tools** (up from 18) — 17 read-only inspection
  + 3 state-changing (`click`, `set-text`, `send-keys`).
- `ControlInteractor.ClickOutcome` renamed to `InteractionOutcome` (it now
  serves click, set-text, and send-keys). Internal type — no public API
  impact.
- `CLAUDE.md`, the architecture diagram, and the `Key Source Locations`
  table updated to reflect three state-changing commands.

### Testing

All 48 existing unit tests pass against this change.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **CLI mode.** `WpfVisualTreeMcp.Server.exe` now doubles as a one-shot
  command-line tool whenever it's invoked with a recognised subcommand
  (`list`, `attach`, `tree`, `find`, `props`, `bindings`, `screenshot`, ...).
  With no arguments it still runs as the MCP stdio server, exactly as before.
  - The CLI is dispatched from `Program.cs` via the new
    [`CliRunner`](src/WpfVisualTreeMcp.Server/Cli/CliRunner.cs).
  - Output is JSON on stdout (`--compact` for single-line), with logging
    forced to stderr so the output stays pipe-friendly.
  - `screenshot` writes a PNG file and prints its path (so an AI agent can
    re-read the image with its normal file-read tool, no base64 round-trip).
  - `export` writes to `--out` if given, otherwise prints content inline.
  - Each invocation is stateless — element handles live inside the Inspector
    in the target process, so they remain valid across separate CLI calls.

- **`wpf_click_element` MCP tool and `click` CLI command.** Interact with WPF
  controls — the first state-changing capability in an otherwise read-only
  tool.
  - **Default (UI Automation):** invokes the control's action via the first
    matching automation pattern — `Invoke` for buttons/menu items/hyperlinks,
    `Toggle` for checkboxes/radio buttons, `Select` for list/tab/combo items,
    expand/collapse for expanders. No cursor movement, no window focus.
    Elements with no pattern fall back to best-effort routed mouse events.
  - **`physical=true` / `--physical`:** real OS mouse click at the element's
    on-screen centre. Works on any visible element, but moves the cursor and
    brings the window forward.
  - Implemented in
    [`ControlInteractor`](src/WpfVisualTreeMcp.Inspector/ControlInteractor.cs)
    in the Inspector.

- **User-level Claude Code skill** for the wpf-inspector tooling (lives
  outside the repo under the user's `.claude/skills/wpf-inspector/`).
  Documents all 18 commands and bundles a self-contained Release build so it
  works in any project.

### Changed

- `WpfTools` now exposes **18 tools** (up from 17).
- `CLAUDE.md`, the architecture diagram, and the `Key Source Locations`
  table updated for dual-mode operation and the new `ControlInteractor`.
- `WpfVisualTreeMcp.Inspector` (net48 build) now references
  `UIAutomationProvider` and `UIAutomationTypes`; net8.0-windows pulls them
  in automatically via `UseWPF=true`.

### Known limitations

- **Auto-injection is same-architecture only.** A 64-bit CLI/MCP server
  cannot inject into a 32-bit target — the remote `LoadLibraryW` thread
  starts at the injector's 64-bit `kernel32` address, which is invalid in
  the target's 32-bit address space, and the bootstrapper never runs (silent
  "Injection failed", no log entries). For 32-bit WPF apps use **self-hosted
  mode** (reference the Inspector and call
  `InspectorService.Initialize(Process.GetCurrentProcess().Id)` in
  `OnStartup`), or ship an x86 build of the server. A clearer error message
  on bitness mismatch is a planned follow-up.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- Added `claude mcp add` command line instructions for easier Claude Code configuration
- Updated documentation with multiple configuration options (CLI vs JSON)

### Changed

#### Migration to Official MCP SDK
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from custom MCP protocol implementation to official [Microsoft/Anthropic MCP SDK for .NET](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk)
- **BREAKING**: Configuration now requires direct path to `.exe` file instead of `dotnet run`
- Simplified `Program.cs` from 55 lines to 28 lines using SDK's built-in features
- All 13 WPF inspection tools now use `[McpServerTool]` attributes for auto-discovery
- Improved protocol compatibility and stability with Claude Code

#### Benefits of Migration
- ✅ **Guaranteed compatibility** with Claude Code and other MCP clients
- ✅ **Faster connection** (~463ms vs previous timeouts)
- ✅ **Automatic protocol negotiation** - no more version mismatches
- ✅ **Better maintainability** - SDK handles all JSON-RPC details
- ✅ **Official support** from Microsoft/Anthropic

#### Technical Changes
- Added NuGet dependency: `ModelContextProtocol` (v0.4.1-preview.1)
- Removed custom `McpServer.cs` protocol implementation (722 lines → SDK managed)
- Created new `WpfTools.cs` with declarative tool definitions
- Simplified logging configuration - completely disabled for stdio protocol
- Removed UTF-8 BOM encoding issues that caused JSON parse errors

### Fixed
- Fixed connection timeout issues with Claude Code (was 30+ seconds, now <500ms)
- Fixed JSON parsing errors caused by log output on stdout
- Fixed protocol version negotiation (now accepts client's version)
- Fixed notification handling (no longer sends error responses for notifications)

### Migration Guide

**Old Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wpf-visual-tree": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "path/to/WpfVisualTreeMcp.Server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**New Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wpf-visual-tree": {
      "command": "C:/path/to/WpfVisualTreeMcp/src/WpfVisualTreeMcp.Server/bin/Release/net8.0/WpfVisualTreeMcp.Server.exe",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Build the project: `dotnet build -c Release`
2. Update your MCP configuration with absolute path to the `.exe`
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Verify tools appear with `mcp__wpf-visual-tree__` prefix
